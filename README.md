# Cat Database
<strong>Language: HTML/CSS+Bootstrap/JS+Node+Express/MongoDB</strong>

Capture POST request data and save to MongoDB via Mongoose. Load and display DB contents via Mongoose and EJS template.

I also used Bootstrap to slap on some really quick and dirty styling. I’m starting to appreciate its usefulness in this regard. 

Finally, I had to use MongoLab and environment variables to support different databases between localhost and my Heroku deployment.

Getting everything properly installed and configured gave me quite a few problems, so it’s very satisfying to see this all working.
